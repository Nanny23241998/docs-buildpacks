This feature is not available by default in older deployments that do not use CAPI v3 API or later. 

You can use the [Multi-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/multi-buildpack) to provide older Cloud Foundry deployments with the same multi-buildpack support that is available with CAPI v3 API.
