This topic describes how developers can push an application with multiple buildpacks.

For more information about pushing applications to Cloud Foundry, see the [Deploy an Application](../devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) topic.

##<a id='cfcli'></a> Specifying Buildpacks with the cf CLI

To push an application with multiple buildpacks using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI), perform the following procedure:

1. Ensure you are using the cf CLI v6.32.0+:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf version
  cf version 6.32.0+0191c33d9.2017-09-26
  </pre>
  For more information about upgrading the cf CLI, see [Installing the cf CLI](../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).
1. Push the application with the binary buildpack with the `--no-start` flag:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf push YOUR-APP --no-start -b binary_buildpack</pre>
  This command pushes the application but does not start it.
1. Upgrade the application to multiple buildpacks, and specify the buildpacks:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf v3-push YOUR-APP -b BUILDPACK-NAME-1 -b BUILDPACK-NAME-2
  </pre>
  This command changes the buildpack and starts the application. To see a list of available buildpacks, run `cf buildpacks`.

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The two-push workflow is currently required because only <code>v3-push</code> supports multiple buildpacks.</p>

For more information about V3 commands, see the [Using Experimental cf CLI Commands](../devguide/v3-commands.html) topic. The `v3-push` command has the following restrictions:

* `v3-push` currently only supports a subset of features of `push`. In particular, it does not support the following:
  * application manifests
  * flags to set the stack or modify the default mapped route 
  * exclusions from a `.cfignore` file
* If you use an application manifest, you cannot include the `buildpack` key or future pushes will not function properly.
* You can use the following commands to update the configuration of an application started with `v3-push`: 
  * `map-route`
  * `bind-service`
  * `v3-set-env`
  * `v3-scale`
  * `v3-set-health-check`

For more information about V3 commands, see the [Using Experimental cf CLI Commands](../devguide/v3-commands.html) topic.
